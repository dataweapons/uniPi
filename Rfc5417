*** Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) ***

In most of the networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options
   prior to network access authentication is neither integrity protected
   nor origin authenticated.  Therefore, in security sensitive
   environments, the options defined in this document SHOULD NOT be the
   only methods used to determine to which AC a WTP should connect.  The
   CAPWAP protocol [RFC5415] defines other AC discovery procedures a WTP
   may utilize.
