Best to keep them separated.\r\n    - Strategic deployment of radios (AP's) tuned at 20Hz spread over channels 1, 6, and 11 is the path to a virtuous network.\r\n    - such situations call for proper engineering.  The kind that involves packets, routes, ciphers, algebra, calculus, and planning.\r\n \r\n===============================================\r\n[2] Implementation and integration requirements\r\n===============================================\r\n\r\n    - TCP/IP Ethernet network deployment that implements:\r\n      * IPv4 and/or IPv6 address space for dedicated WLAN subnets for each private and guest subnet/VLAN.  \r\n      * static routing, ARP and MAC tables,\r\n      * support for Power over Ethernet (POE),\r\n      * iphelper or DNS/DHCP proxying,\r\n      * Layer Two (L2) and Layer Three (L3) switching and routing infrastructure:\r\n        + VLAN topology,\r\n        + port security,\r\n        + rules based network seperation and isolation\r\n\r\n    - IEEE 802.11b deployment that implements:\r\n      * Data rates,\r\n      * channels,\r\n      * power levels\r\n\r\n    - IEEE 802.1x deployment that implements:\r\n      * Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) [a]\r\n      * AAA and Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS),\r\n      * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and/or TKIP\r\n\r\n    - DHCP deployment that implements [b]:\r\n      * seperate, dedicated DHCP scopes for each private and guest WLAN subnet/VLAN,\r\n      * BOOTP vendor extensions and DHCP options 43, 60, 82, and 138 [c],\r\n      * DHCP user-class option for 'IPConnectionMetric' [d],\r\n      * DHCP search options 015, 119,\r\n      * DHCP scope options:\r\n        + max-lease-time\r\n        + subnet-mask\r\n        + broadcast-address\r\n        + routers\r\n        + domain-name-servers\r\n        + domain-name\r\n\r\n    - Wireless Access Point (WAP) deployment that implements:\r\n      * CAPWAP standards [e],\r\n      * Lightweight AP Registration (LAP) [f],\r\n      * condition based isolation of client connections,\r\n      * http redirects to front-facing 'guest portal',\r\n\r\n    - DNS deployment that implements:\r\n      * seperate, dedicated forward and reverse zones for each private and guest WLAN subnet/VLAN,\r\n      * client-side dynamic updates for WLAN forward and reverse zones,\r\n      * static host records that resolve to 'unifi',\r\n      * DNSSEC security extensions.\r\n\r\n    - domain deployment that implements:\r\n      * Network Access Controls (NAC) authorization and quarantining [g],\r\n      * authentication and authorization services,\r\n      * role-based access to networked resources,\r\n      * directory services (i.e: Active Directory, LDAP) based lookups,\r\n      * network-based logging and auditing integrating network and host accesses,\r\n      * accurate time-keeping.\r\n\r\n    - PKI deployment that implements:\r\n      * TLS 1.2,\r\n      * Certificate Authority,\r\n      * certificate Revocation Lists (CRL),\r\n      * Network Device Auto-Enrollment,\r\n      * OCSP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=============\r\n[3] FOOTNOTES\r\n=============\r\n\r\n[a] RFC 2716 - PPP EAP TLS Authentication Protocol: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2716.txt\r\n\r\n[b] RFC 2131 - Dynamic Host Control Protocol: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt\r\n\r\n[c] RFC 2132 - DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132\r\n\r\n[d] Microsoft DNS specific: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa394217(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\n[e] RFC 5415 - Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol Spec.: https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5415.txt\r\n\r\n[f] http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/70333-lap-registration.html\r\n\r\n[g] such as Cisco Clean Access, Microsoft Network Access Protection, and others\r\n\r\n",
