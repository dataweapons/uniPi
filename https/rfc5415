*** Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol Specification ***

   In order for CAPWAP to be compatible with potential middleboxes in
   the network, CAPWAP implementations MUST send return traffic from the
   same port on which they received traffic from a given peer.  Further,
   any unsolicited requests generated by a CAPWAP node MUST be sent on
   

   When the WTP attempts to establish communication with an AC, it sends
   the Discovery Request message and receives the Discovery Response
   message from the AC(s).  The WTP MUST send the Discovery Request
   message to either the limited broadcast IP address (255.255.255.255),
   the well-known CAPWAP multicast address (224.0.1.140), or to the
   unicast IP address of the AC.  For IPv6 networks, since broadcast
   does not exist, the use of "All ACs multicast address" (FF0X:0:0:0:0:
   0:0:18C) is used instead.  Upon receipt of the Discovery Request
   message, the AC sends a Discovery Response message to the unicast IP
   address of the WTP, regardless of whether the Discovery Request
   message was sent as a broadcast, multicast, or unicast message
